## Two examples illustrating Design A and B

![Design A](/designA-cell-death.png)

This is circuit A, where the MNP DmpR compound activates the TOXIN. Some time after degradation has started the cell dies. Without the pesticide OOP the cell would never degrade anything and live happily ever after. This poses the risk of breaching the wastewater treatment plant.



![Design B](/designB-cell-death.png)

This is circuit B, where the MNP DmpR compound activates the ANTITOXIN, so when no degradation happens the MNP DmpR compound doesn't lead to antitoxin production and the cell dies. This design can not live without the pesticide present, thus is contained by design.
